Enterprise Data Modeling

1. Understanding Data Modeling

Common Terminologies
a. Model: A scaled-down, non fucntional representation of an object, system or idea. (Data Mindsets).
and Diagrams: A two-dimensional visual representation that is often abstracted or symbolic.

Data Model is a collection of metadata that represents the logical orginazation, shape and meaning of data.

b. Domain (Table): Describes the area and boundaries of a data element. Its describes how values are stored.

c. Kinds of data (Master or Transactional)
Master Data that describes an entity, place or thing. Master data doesnt change often, its rare in change (Customer, Place, Thing).
Transactional Data are like, purchase, check-in, auto-orders.
Lookup (dimensional tables)data describes codes / IDs with FK, "W" = work phone
Metadata (attributes) describes the item, descriptions, data types.

d. Logical vs Physical. You dont model a table, you model an entity. A Table is a container. You are describing an Entity (Customer). Relationship is an action that joins entities together.


RELATIONAL DATA MODEL

When you break your data into entities, you are normalizing your data.
