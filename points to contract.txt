The reason behind these seperate tables is to address each entity with their reference id. My own suggestion.
EMPLOYEE_ADDDRESS TABLE  (Emp_id)
JOBSITE_ADDRESS TABLE (Job_id)

Itâ€™s no secret that technology is changing the way the construction industry operates. What is considered as one of the final frontiers for technology, the construction industry has seen the highest amount of venture capital activity of any technology sector.

Six predictions for the future of the equipment side of the construction industry:

Digitization of rental commerce and operations
Adoption of telematics for improved preventative maintenance
Advancement of VR/AR for improved training in alignment with the new ANSI standards
Adoption of semi-autonomous equipment for safer inspection and operation
Growth in telehandler sales leading to smaller fleets and higher utilization
Adoption of 100% hybrid and electric fleets
Technology needs to be thought of as workforce enablement, not as workforce replacement. To date, there is a reluctance to adopt technology on the commerce side of the business either out of fear of being replaced, satisfaction with the status quo, or a lack of urgency to innovate.

The use of technology and the data that comes with it allows equipment rental companies and operators to focus more time and energy on the human element of the business that has built this industry.

It allows us to be smarter around our economic decision making, more efficient with our sales and fulfillment, and more personalized with the customer experience we provide.

The biggest shift is in our perception of technology and our behavior as consumers of it.
